Your Client
Eureka Forbes offers solutions in water purification, vacuum clearing, air purification, and
security solutions. The company sells both household and industrial products and uses a
multi-channel distribution system, having started with direct sales and later adding retailing
to its mix. In 2018 the company was estimated to have a customer base of 20+ million
across 40+ countries. While Eureka is a multi-product company, their flagship product
focuses on water purification and they have established themselves as a household name in
the company’s domestic market of India.
Millions of customers visit the Eureka Forbes website and of course many end up not being
converted into prospects. The company spends millions of dollars annually on digital
marketing campaigns in order to try to turn site visitors into prospects (for lead generation)
and eventually satisfied customers.
